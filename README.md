## About ProtoLab
### What is ProtoLab
ProtoLab is a collection of small videogame prototypes based on specific themes.  
Think of it as a _Game Jam-like projects_, but mainly dessigned for **practice and experimentation**

## Current ProtoLab
> **Theme:** _Space_  
> **Schedule:** Sep 22, 2025 -> Sep 28, 2025  
> **Status:** Playable

### Game Modes
Originally was planned to have 3 different game modes, but due lack of time and some unforeseen events, could only include one.   
_Planned Gamemodes:_
- **Classic** (Done)  
> Survive as long as you can or until you run out of oxygen. Collect as many stars as possible while dodging randomized planets!

- **Gravity** (Planned for future releases)
> Same as Classic, but now you don't need to worry about running out of oxygen Instead, focus on avoiding the gravity of the planets  
- **Orbit** (Planned for future releases)
> You found yourself orbiting a planet, Dodge meteorites, orbiting moons, collect stars and survive as long as you can without crashing into the planet or drifting out of orbit  

**Note**: While these modes are planned for future versions, there's no guarantee they'll be completed. ProtoLab has deadlines to transition into new projectss, but with free time between them, I may continue working on these aditional modes
